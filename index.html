  <h2>Who is MOONHWAN LEE / 이문환 ? </h1>
  <p>I am an <u>interaction designer and  a design researcher</u> interested in systems, services, and products that can shape people, societies, and cultures in profound ways. My background spans industrial design and Human-Computer Interaction. As a designer and a researcher, I am exploring ways to bridge the gap between design research and practice. I finished my PhD course in the CIDR lab at KAIST where I work with Tek-Jin Nam, and several esteemed lab members (http://cidr.kaist.ac.kr). Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the department of design at <a href ="http://www.kpu.ac.kr/mainEng_2016/index.do" target="_blank" title = "KPU WEBSITE"> Korea Polytechnic University (KPU)</a>, South Korea.</p>
