  <h2> Course </h1>
  <p>Recent developments in digital fabrication and computational design offer new opportunities to encode data in 2D or 3D forms and have stimulated the emergence of data-inspired product design (e.g. data sculpture, and data jewelry). Personal and public data can be a source of inspiration for product design. By making invisible data to visible and tangible, it is possible to enhance the aesthetic quality of a product and embed stories and messages in a product. The workshop will provide opportunities for participants to explore data-inspired product design during a hands-on session, by creating their own prototypes. These practical explorations will lead into reflective discussions on the role of designers and challenges for this design approach.</p>
